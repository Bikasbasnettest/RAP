# RAP
Creation of the Relative abundance plot in R for the study of bacterial species abundance in any sphere 
#Ecology and Biology:

#Microbial communities: Visualize the relative abundance of different bacterial species in a microbiome or the composition of plankton in a water sample.
Plant and animal communities: Show the relative abundance of plant species in a forest or animal species in an ecosystem.
#Cell biology: Represent the relative abundance of different proteins or RNA transcripts within a cell.
Environmental Science:

#Pollution analysis: Depict the relative abundance of different pollutants in air, water, or soil samples.
Sediment analysis: Visualize the proportion of different grain sizes or mineral compositions in a sediment sample.
